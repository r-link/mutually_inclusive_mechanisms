## Description
The present repository is part of Hajek, Link et al. (2021) and contains the code necessary for preparing the dataset and fitting the hierarchical Bayesian model described in the paper.

It will be published as a public Github repository under the link https://github.com/r-link/mutually_inclusive_mechanisms upon the release of the publication.

## Structure
The documents in the root folder (`/`) perform the basic steps of the data analysis.
The raw data are in the `/data` folder, the `/stan` folder contains the Stan code required for
model fitting, and intermediate results and model output are stored in `/output`.
Visual output generated after running script 06 is stored in `/figures`.
